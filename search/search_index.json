In addition you must set either the FORTUTF_PROJECT_SRC_FILES variable to point to the location of the FORTRAN source files for your project, or the FORTUTF_PROJECT_SRC_LIBRARY variable to give the location of the library generated by building your project. By default FortUTF will assume tests to lie within ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests , you can override this by setting FORTUTF_PROJECT_TEST_DIR to your tests directory. It is recommended that compiling and running of the tests be controlled by a CMake option: # Project CMakeLists.txt OPTION( BUILD_TESTS \"Build Project Unit tests\" OFF ) IF( BUILD_TESTS ) # set required project files variable e.g. files in 'src' directory within the project directory FILE( GLOB_RECURSE PROJECT_SRC_FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.f90 ) # Include the FortUTF test finding script SET( FORTUTF_ROOT /path/to/FortUTF/folder ) INCLUDE( ${FORTUTF_ROOT}/cmake/fortutf.cmake ) ... ENDIF() The script will automatically locate any tests within the project matching the pattern test_*.f90 , and create a new script run_tests.f90 within the build directory which will be compiled. Writing Unit tests # To write unit tests create an F90 script prefixed with test_ in a test directory and write the tests as subroutines within a modules. The subroutine TAG_TEST can be called prior to the assertion to provide an identifier for recognising the test within the results should it fail, if a tag is not provided the test will be named Test <N> where N is the test number.
