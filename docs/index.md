# FORTRAN Unit Test Framework

FortUTF is a purely FORTRAN-ic unit test framework compatible with FORTRAN 90 code. It contains a set of subroutines which can be used to check outputs of methods. Note FortUTF makes use of subroutines available in Fortran-2008 so a compatible compiler is required.

FortUTF has been confirmed to work under Linux, macOS and Windows via MSYS.
