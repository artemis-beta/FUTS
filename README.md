**NOTE**: FortUTF DOES currently work for GFortran 11 on Windows, for some reason the CI on GitHub is having issues.

## Introduction

FortUTF is Unit Test framework written purely in FORTRAN to be compatible with as many projects as possible. The framework is still in development so documentation is limited, but I promise once it is complete documentation will be a priority. For now I will introduce the basics.


## Writing Tests

All assertions in the current state can be found in the file `src/assertions.f90`. To write a test you only need to create a file containing one a subroutine for each test you wish to run. You can use the available macro script contained within FortUTF which will construct a main script to build and run the tests.

### Example Project

Contained within this repository is an example project which demonstrates usage of the framework in the form:

```bash
demo_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src
│   └── demo_functions.f90
└── tests
    └── test_functions.f90
```

the functions which we would like to test are contained within the project `src` folder. When building tests it is important that you give this location, or the name of a compiled library to FortUTF using either the variable `SRC_FILES` or `SRC_LIBRARY`, the contents of the `CMakeLists.txt` shows this in practice, and point it to the location of our tests using the `FORTUTF_PROJECT_TEST_DIR` variable.
In addition to include a directory containing module (`.mod`) files required
to build the library being tested set the variable `FORTUTF_PROJECT_MOD_DIR` to this location.

```cmake
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 3.12)

PROJECT(DEMO_PROJ LANGUAGES Fortran)

MESSAGE(STATUS "[FortUTF Example Project Build]")
MESSAGE(STATUS "\tProject Source Directory: ${PROJECT_ROOT}")

GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(FORTUTF_ROOT ../../ ABSOLUTE)

SET(FORTUTF_PROJECT_TEST_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests)
FILE(GLOB SRC_FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.f90)

INCLUDE(${FORTUTF_ROOT}/cmake/fortutf.cmake)
FortUTF_Find_Tests()
```

by including the file `cmake/fortutf.cmake` from within this repository we have access to the `FortUTF_Find_Tests` macro. We can place as many scripts in our `FORTUTF_PROJECT_TEST_DIR` location. An example script for this project is:

```fortran
MODULE TEST_DEMO_FUNCTIONS
    USE FORTUTF
    USE DEMO_FUNCTIONS

    CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE TEST_DEMO_FUNC_1
        USE DEMO_FUNCTIONS, ONLY: DEMO_FUNC_1
        CALL TAG_TEST("TEST_DEMO_FUNC_1")
        CALL ASSERT_EQUAL(DEMO_FUNC_1(10), 95)
    END SUBROUTINE
    SUBROUTINE TEST_DEMO_FUNC_2
        USE DEMO_FUNCTIONS, ONLY: DEMO_FUNC_2
        CALL TAG_TEST("TEST_DEMO_FUNC_2")
        CALL ASSERT_EQUAL(DEMO_FUNC_2(11D0), 32D0)
    END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE TEST_DEMO_FUNCTIONS
```

Firstly we must include the `FORTUTF` module in every test script, then in order for FortUFT to be able to provide labels to any failing tests we tag using the `TAG_TEST` subroutine (not providing a tag will name the test `Test <N>` where `N` is the test number). Finally we call a test subroutine, and that's it!

To build this example we would then just run `cmake` within the project directory:

```bash
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```

this will create a script `run_tests.f90` in the build directory and compile it into a binary.


## Running the Framework Unit Tests

Even a test framework needs tests! FortUTF uses its own style of running to test
all the assertions are behaving properly, to run the tests build them by
running cmake with the option:

```bash
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
```

the compiled binary is always named `<PROJECT_NAME>_Tests` and is run to execute the tests:

```bash
./build/FortUTF_Tests
```

Optionally you can specify tests to run by the tagged name:

```bash
./build/FortUTF_Tests TEST_FAIL_EQUAL_CHAR TEST_EQUAL_CHAR
```


## Troubleshooting

If you experience any problems:

- Try deleting the build directory and starting again.
- Try putting the test subroutines into a module
